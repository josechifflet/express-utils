/**
 * Custom middleware for parsing JSON request bodies in Express.
 *
 * This middleware selectively parses JSON bodies only for requests where it is explicitly applied.
 * - Using this middleware only on specific routes helps optimize the API by avoiding unnecessary
 *   body parsing on endpoints that don't require JSON payloads, saving bandwidth and processing power.
 *
 * - Additionally, the middleware validates `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers to ensure
 *   compatibility with expected JSON payloads, enhancing security and reliability.
 *
 * @param req - Express.js request object containing incoming HTTP request data.
 * @param res - Express.js response object to send data back to the client.
 * @param next - Express.js `next` function to pass control to the next middleware.
 * @returns A customized instance of `express.json`, tailored for selective JSON parsing.

  // Validate the `Content-Length` header to prevent excessively large payloads.
  // - `Content-Length` specifies the size of the request body in bytes.
  // - By checking this header, the middleware can reject oversized payloads before fully parsing them,
  //   which improves efficiency and protects against denial-of-service attacks due to large payloads.
  // - Here, a threshold of 512 bytes is set, but this limit can be adjusted based on API requirements.

  // - `type`: Set to 'application/json' to reinforce that only JSON payloads are parsed.
  // - `limit`: A hard limit of 512 bytes, ensuring the payload does not exceed the acceptable size.
  //
  // This middleware returns the parsed JSON data, allowing subsequent middleware or route handlers
  // to access the request body as a JavaScript object.
