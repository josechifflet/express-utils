/**
 * Configures and creates an instance of `express-slow-down` with Redis as the storage backend.
 * 
 * This middleware helps mitigate spamming and rapid consecutive requests by progressively slowing
 * down responses once a certain threshold of requests is reached. Using Redis as the storage layer
 * allows this middleware to function across distributed instances of the application, supporting 
 * scalability and preventing abuse in high-demand environments.
 *
 * The rate-limiting strategy:
 * - Allows a specified number of requests (`delayAfter`) within a 15-minute window.
 * - Once the threshold is reached, introduces an incremental delay on each subsequent request.
 * - Delay is calculated based on the number of requests over the limit, with a customizable delay per request.
 *
 * @param redis - An active Redis instance, used to store request counts and manage throttling limits.
 * @param delayAfter - Maximum allowed requests before throttling begins.
 * @returns Configured instance of `express-slow-down` middleware for global use.
