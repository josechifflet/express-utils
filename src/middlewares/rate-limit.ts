/**
 * Configures a rate limiter middleware for Express routes to control the number of incoming requests.
 *
 * Rate limiting is essential for protecting endpoints from excessive requests, preventing spam and abuse,
 * and ensuring fair usage of server resources. This function integrates `express-rate-limit` with a Redis-based
 * storage layer to manage request counts across distributed environments, making it ideal for large-scale applications.
 *
 * This rate limiter:
 * - Tracks request counts in Redis with a specified key prefix, enabling separate rate limits for different routes or clients.
 * - Returns a `429 Too Many Requests` error if the limit is exceeded, with an error message indicating the retry time.
 * - Supports customizable settings for request limits, time windows, and Redis key prefixes.
 *
 * @param redis - A Redis instance, used to store and track request counts.
 * @param max - Maximum number of requests allowed within the specified time window.
 * @param prefix - A unique prefix for Redis keys used in rate limiting (e.g., "user", "api", or "admin"). Defaults to "common".
 * @param minutes - The duration, in minutes, for which the rate limit window is active. Defaults to 15 minutes.
 * @returns A configured rate limiter middleware for use in Express routes.
